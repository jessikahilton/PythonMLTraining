# PythonMLTraining

Starting April 2019, I began teaching python in a machine learning context to those at my company who have an interest, particularly my
analytics and reporting team.  Over the next few weeks / months, I'll be adding to the repo as I generate new content.

For relatability and relevancy, we are using data we work with on a daily basis, and because of the sensitivity of that data and client
confidentiality, I will not be providing those files.  

Keep in mind that, while I have cursory knowledge in python, the majority of the content is created as I learn the concepts myself, and 
will not be perfect.  I aim to improve over time, but it's a process.  I am sure there are 500 ways to do what I'm doing, and I'm sure the 
majority of those approaches are more technically correct, more efficient, or more standard, but I'm learning as I go, and will improve 
over time.  

My main goal with this "training" is to bring python tools and understanding to our reporting and analytics department to developers who 
have no experience in python, and the majority of whom have no experience in programming in general.  My approach is to teach basics and
fundamentals as we go through algorithms and ML techniques, and I choose depth of knowledge in python for machine learning over breadth 
of knowledge in python for general scripting and programming.  Yes, it is a niche skill set, and yes, it is a niche topic for python, and
yes, python can do so much more than what I'm choosing to cover, but those are the skills relevant to my department and my personal career
goals. 

Feel free to use the code I've provided and apply it to your own datasets. Kaggle is a great resource for data sets that are
typically pretty clean and easily available.
